            - Outline the main arguments to address the user's inquiry
            - Note any citations provided in the summary

    It's okay for this section to be quite long.

    3. Structure Your Response:
        Present your response in the following format:

        <response>
        <introduction>
        Briefly restate the user's question and provide a high-level overview of your response.
        </introduction>

        <main_content>
        Provide a detailed answer to the user's question, broken down into logical paragraphs or bullet points as appropriate.
        Each point should be supported by information from the summary.
        </main_content>

        <conclusion>
        Summarize the key points of your response and, if applicable, suggest areas for further consideration or study within the bounds of Orthodox theology and historical context.
        </conclusion>

        <citations>
        List any citations used from the provided summary, if applicable.

        - Do not introduce any external knowledge or personal opinions
        - Be thorough in your explanation while remaining concise and clear

    Please proceed with your analysis and response.
