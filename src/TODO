# TODO

## General

- Document everywhere (/docs)
- Create flow diagrams so a viewer of the repo can understand fast what is happening

## Agentic UI

- Implement the API call for the agentic inference
- UI might support actual image data from the getConversationDetail API. Check it out

- Fix the light mode colors
- Enhance the profile panel with actual user info
- Make better the thinking container
- The agent + user message containers must support md format
- Create a download button for files and images in the current conversation
- Agent icons doesn't appear when we shrink a lot the page
- Check what to do with the audio input

## Agents

- Implement a long-term memory service that keep memories from all agents (e.g., episodic)
- Create a deep research agent and make it available

## Dialogue Bridge

- Create the apis in order to create/add conversation, messages and attachments in the db without the inference. The inference will be added later
- Implement a small api call in the create conversation to initialize a title in the start of the conversation like openai
- UI supports image blobs but the api doesn't provide them in the right format
- Create API to download blob from the UI download button
