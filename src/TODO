# TODO

## General

- Document everywhere (/docs)

## Agentic UI

- Implement the API call for the agentic inference
- UI doesn't support actual image data from the getConversation API. Must be decoded from base64 to file objects
- Remove the useless schemas Conversation, Message etc.
- Fix the light mode colors
- Enhance the profile panel with actual user info
- Make better the thinking container
- The agent + user message containers must support md format
- Create a download button for files and images in the current conversation
- Agent icons doesn't appear when we shrink a lot the page
- Check what to do with the audio input

## Agents

- Implement a long-term memory service that keep memories from all agents (e.g., episodic)
- Create a deep research agent and make it available

## Dialogue Bridge

- Create the api in order to create/add conversation, messages and attachments in the db without the inference. The inference will be added later.
- UI supports image blobs but the api doesnt provide them in the right format.
- Create API to download blob from the UI download button
